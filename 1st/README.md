### Problem 1
Answer the following problems. Source cides and their execution results should be included in your report.


**1.** Generate a sparse matrix A by using the Scilab function sprand, and write a Scilab program to store the matrix A in CRS format.


**2.** Write a Scilab program to perform the matrix-vector multiplication in CRS format. Then, calculate norm(y1 - y2), where y1 = A * x, y2 is a result computed by sparse matrix-vector multiplication in CRS format, and x is a nonzero ncols-dimensional vector.


**3.** Let A be an n * n symmetric matrix. Let A<sub>D</sub> and Let A<sub>L</sub> be the diagonal part if A and the lower triangular part of A, respectively. Store the matrix A<sub>L</sub> i CRS format, and the matrix A<sub>D</sub> i 1-dimensional array.

Write a Scilab program to perform the matrix-vector multiplication:

z = Ax = (A<sub>L</sub> + A<sub>D</sub> + A<sub>D</sub><sup>T</sup>)x


Then, calculate norm(z1 - z2), where z1 = A * x, z2 is a result computed by sparse matrix-vector multiplication in CRS format, and x is an n-dimensional nonzero vector.

[Hint]Sparse symmetric matrix A can be generated by

A = sprand(1000, 1000, 0.005); A = A.' + A;
